Details:
- These .par files were determined using the Boris noise models dr2 subbanded tim files. 
- New parameters were added if they passed the AIC. 
- Pulsars were converted to ELL1 model if the error induced by this approximation was less than 0.01*Wrms/sqrt(Ntoa)
- J1909 was converted to a Kopeikin term model
- Other binary pulsars have not had Kopeikin terms and Shapiro delays added - this will be done in ver2
